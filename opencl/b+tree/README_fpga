# Problem size

The problem size is defined by the input file specified by the -file command-line parameter.

# Work-group configuration

The number of threads in a work group with NDRange kernels is defined in problem_size.h. Macros DEFAULT_ORDER and DEFAULT_ORDER_2 define the sizes of the two kernels, kernel_gpu_opencl_v?.cl and kernel_gpu_opencl_2_v?.cl, respectively, where v? is a version number. They can be changed for example as follows:

```
make ALTERA=1 BOARD=AOC_BOARD_NAME KERNEL_DIM="-DRD_WG_SIZE_0_0=16 -DRD_WG_SIZE_1_0=16"
```

# How to Run the Benchmark

The benchmark accepts two command-line parameters and a version specifier. The parameters serve as a problem input file and search command file, respectively. 
```
./b+tree.out file ../../data/b+tree/mil.txt command ../../data/b+tree/command.txt [v0|v1]
```

# Results

Problem size (16, 16) failed to be compiled for Cyclone V with an error message of "Cannot fit kernel(s) on device".
